# CS-2210-Data-Structures-Algorithms

The purpose of this course is to provide the students with solid foundations in the basic concepts
of programming: Data structures and algorithms. The main objective of the course is to teach the
students how to select and design data structures and algorithms that are appropriate for problems
that they might encounter. This course is also about showing the correctness of algorithms and
studying their computational complexities. This course offers the students a mixture of theoretical
knowledge and practical experience.

The study of data structures and algorithms is carried out within an object-oriented framework.
When implementations are considered, the Java programming language is used. Topics covered in
this course include:

- Design and analysis of algorithms
- Time complexity and asymptotic notation
- Dictionaries and hash tables
- Trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, multi-way search trees, (2,4)-trees, and B-trees
- Graphs, graph traversals, and graph algorithms
- Sorting algorithms.
